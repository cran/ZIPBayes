Description: Implementation of zero-inflated Poisson models under Bayesian framework using data augmentation as discussed in Chapter 5 of Zhang (2020) <https://hdl.handle.net/10012/16378>. This package is constructed in accommodating four different scenarios: the general scenario, the scenario with measurement error in responses, the external validation scenario, and the internal validation scenario.
